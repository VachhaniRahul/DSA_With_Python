# A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the:

# Left child

# Right child


# ðŸ“Œ Key Properties

# Root node â†’ The topmost node of the tree.

# Parent & Child â†’ Any node that has children is called a parent, and its successors are children.

# Leaf node â†’ A node with no children.

# Height of tree â†’ The length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.

# Depth of node â†’ The distance from the root to that node.

# Size of tree â†’ The total number of nodes in the tree.



# ðŸ“Œ Types of Binary Trees

# Full Binary Tree â†’ Every node has either 0 or 2 children. except 1 childern is not allowed

# Complete Binary Tree â†’ All levels are completely filled except possibly the last, which is filled left to right.

# Perfect Binary Tree â†’ All internal nodes have 2 children and all leaves are at the same level.

# Binary Search Tree (BST) â†’ A binary tree where left child < root < right child.
